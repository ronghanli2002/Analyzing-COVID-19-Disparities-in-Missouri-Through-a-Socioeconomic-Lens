## Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has had profound impacts worldwide, with significant variations in infection rates across different regions and populations. Socioeconomic factors, such as income levels, education, healthcare access, and employment, are known to influence health outcomes and may contribute to disparities in infection rates. Missouri, with its diverse urban and rural communities, provides a unique setting to explore how socioeconomic conditions shape the spread of COVID-19. Understanding these relationships can offer valuable insights for public health interventions and policy decisions aimed at mitigating the impact of future pandemics.
